## ü§î What is Profile Board?

Profile Board provides a flexible canvas where you can:

*   **Upload** your images or add text snippets.
*   **Drag and drop** these assets onto a workspace.
*   **Position and resize** items freely on the canvas.
*   **Delete** items you no longer need.
*   **Export** the final layout (positions and dimensions of items) as JSON data to your clipboard.

Once you have exported your layout as JSON, you can use this data with the [`profileBoard` GitHub Action](https://github.com/whiteSHADOW1234/profileBoard) to automatically build a customized SVG representation of your board. This generated SVG is perfect for showcasing your design directly on your GitHub Profile!

## üöÄ Features

*   **Asset Upload:** Upload images directly from your device. (Text snippet upload could be a future addition).
*   **Interactive Canvas:** Uses SVG for rendering items, allowing smooth interaction.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Easily add items from the sidebar to the canvas or reposition existing items.
*   **Resize Items:** Adjust the width and height of items on the canvas.
*   **Delete Items:** Remove individual items from the canvas or uploaded assets from the sidebar.
*   **Layout Export:** Copy the structure of your canvas items (ID, type, position, dimensions) as JSON to the clipboard.
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes.
*   **Clean UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
